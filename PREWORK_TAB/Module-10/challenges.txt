Teaming up could be the biggest challenge for me during this course. Bootcamp will be very beneficial, but working with others over the computer and not in person is a challenge for me. At my work in the hospital, I am always used to communicating in person, so I believe computer communications might be a little foreign to me at first. I plan on overcoming this challenge by reaching out to the mentors and tutors and classmates early on if I am struggling with a concept. 


Making time might be a challenge for me because I am used to working long 12 hours shifts at work. To help overcome this challenge, I have cut back the days that I work so I can have time for the course work.
